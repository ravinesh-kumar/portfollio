                <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development<br> is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript <br>for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact<br> with them directly. The challenge associated with <br>front end development is that the tools and techniques used to<br> create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer <br>needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

The developer creates components<br> and features that are indirectly accessed by a user through a front-end application<br> or system.

A good web designer needs to have both creative<br> graphic skills and technical skills. They need to be able to visualise <br>how a site will look (the graphical design of the site) and how it will <br>function (conversion of a design into a working website). </p>
